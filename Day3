#day 3 is the easiest yet. we just need to find the largest n digit number possible from a numeric string, without rearranging the numbers.
#for instance, if we wanted the largest 2 digit number in 81912, the number isn't 91 or 98, it's 92.
#as with day 2, the best solution came when I have to solve part 2, so we'll just lay that out here.

        for k in range(n, 0, -1):
            if k == 1:
                best[1] = max(best[1], d)
