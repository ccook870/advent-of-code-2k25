##I figured Day 1, Part 1 was going to be pretty simple. I wanted to figure out a way to scrape directly from the webpage but I'm not good at that yet! so I used a .txt for my array.
##But anyways, python's good for simple math stuff. trick here was learning how to do the dial_size math when it wrapped past, but once I got that, I was rolling. Woohoo!
